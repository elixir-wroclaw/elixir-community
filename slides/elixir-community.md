----

## Our goal

* create Elixir community in Wroclaw
* make Elixir in Wroclaw popular
* convince Ruby users that it is time to switch :)
----

## Our vision

* meeting every month (summer break?) 
* different type of meetings
* convince people to experiment with Elixir
* encourage people to get involved in Elixir community
* workshops!

----

## Meetings format

- 'long' talks (~30 minutes)
- lightning talks
- workshops
- coding
- discussion panel

Note:
presentation longer than 30minutes is a lot of work
you should be capable of selling your idea within half an hour
----

## Engagement

**Community = YOU!**

----

### Feel like helping us in any form?
- want to show your project?
- want to speak on a meeting?
- want to tell us about sth interesing during a lightning talk?
----

### Any other help?

- group logo
- graphics design?
- video recordings?
- help organizing?
----

### Rules?

Do we need a CoC?

... or just be nice to each other?

Note:
- probably we are resonable enough, so that no CoC is necessary
- don't make sth similar to what politicians do: they divide us, so lets not do it here
- be nice, sell your ideas without 
- everyone is welcome here: minorities, foreigners etc.
- has sth uncomfortable happened? reach out to us (organizers)
